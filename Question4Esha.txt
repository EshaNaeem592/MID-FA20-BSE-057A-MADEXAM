
To address the challenge of Bitcoin prices changing frequently, I would recommend implementing an automatic data update mechanism. This can be achieved by scheduling periodic API calls to fetch the latest Bitcoin prices and updating the local database accordingly. By setting up a cron job or using a scheduling library, the server can fetch real-time data at specified intervals, ensuring that the app always displays current prices to users. This approach guarantees accuracy without manual intervention, enhancing the user experience. If you need a code implementation, please let me know.
